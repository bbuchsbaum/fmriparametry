# Stage 4 Refactoring Complete

## Summary
Successfully refactored Stage 4 based on Gemini's architectural analysis to use explicit R²-only classification instead of dummy SE values.

## Key Changes

### 1. Modified `.classify_voxels_for_refinement` Function
- Added support for `se_theta = NULL` to trigger R²-only classification mode
- Made the dual-mode capability explicit and self-documenting
- Added input validation for SE dimensions when provided
- Improved code clarity with step-by-step logic

### 2. Updated Stage 4 Implementation
- Removed the anti-pattern of creating dummy SE matrix (0.1)
- Now passes `se_theta = NULL` to classification function
- Added clear comment explaining that Stage 5 will compute real SEs

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Clarity**: The R²-only mode is now explicit in the code
2. **Enhanced Robustness**: No longer dependent on magic values or implicit threshold assumptions
3. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to thresholds won't break the classification logic
4. **Improved Testability**: Can test R²-only and full modes independently
5. **Cleaner Architecture**: Conditional logic is properly encapsulated within the classification function

## Gemini's Analysis Highlights

### Anti-Pattern Identified
The previous approach of using dummy SE values was identified as a classic anti-pattern:
- **Brittleness**: Success depended on implicit assumptions about threshold values
- **Lack of Clarity**: The intent was obscured by the dummy value
- **Increased Cognitive Load**: Required understanding multiple disconnected pieces

### Architectural Assessment
- The decision to defer SE computation to Stage 5 is **architecturally sound**
- Separates optimization (Stages 2-4) from statistical inference (Stage 5)
- Improves performance by avoiding redundant computation
- Maintains proper separation of concerns

### Trade-offs Acknowledged
- R²-only classification loses one dimension of information
- Cannot identify "well-fit but unstable" voxels (decent R² but high SE)
- This is acceptable given the performance benefits and architectural clarity

## Testing Results
All tests pass with the refactored implementation:
- R²-only mode correctly classifies based solely on R² thresholds
- Full mode (when SEs are available) uses both metrics as designed
- The complete pipeline runs successfully with proper SE computation in Stage 5

## Code Quality Improvements
- **From**: Implicit mode via magic values
- **To**: Explicit dual-mode function with clear semantics
- **Result**: More professional, robust, and maintainable codebase
