# Comprehensive Code Audit Report: fmriparametry Package

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive three-phase audit of the fmriparametry R package was conducted in collaboration with Gemini AI. The package implements parametric HRF estimation using iterative Taylor approximation for fMRI data analysis. While the overall architecture is sophisticated and demonstrates high-quality R development practices, several critical issues were identified that impact correctness, performance, and maintainability.

### Key Findings

1. **Critical Mathematical Error**: Jacobian calculation in Gauss-Newton refinement was missing a factor of 2 (FIXED)
2. **R² Calculation Bug**: Previously fixed intercept issue, but post-refinement calculation remains inconsistent
3. **Severe Code Complexity**: Main function is 1098 lines, violating basic software engineering principles
4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Multiple non-vectorized loops causing unnecessary slowdowns
5. **API Design**: Generally excellent S3 implementation with minor documentation gaps

## Detailed Findings by Phase

### Phase 1: Critical Path Analysis

#### 1.1 Core Algorithm Issues

**Critical: Jacobian Calculation Error** ✅ FIXED
- **Location**: `gauss-newton-refinement.R`, lines 304-305
- **Issue**: Missing factor of 2 in derivative of amplitude w.r.t. parameters
- **Impact**: Incorrect optimization direction, slower convergence
- **Status**: Fixed during audit

**High: Inconsistent R² Calculation**
- **Multiple implementations** across codebase with different logic
- **Post-refinement calculation** missing intercept adjustment
- **Recommendation**: Create single canonical function:
```r
.compute_model_fit <- function(Y_true, Y_pred, Y_original_for_ss_tot = NULL) {
  Y_for_ss_tot <- if (!is.null(Y_original_for_ss_tot)) Y_original_for_ss_tot else Y_true
  ss_res <- colSums((Y_true - Y_pred)^2)
  ss_tot <- colSums(scale(Y_for_ss_tot, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)^2)
  r_squared <- ifelse(ss_tot > 1e-10, 1 - ss_res / ss_tot, 0)
  pmax(0, pmin(1, r_squared))
}
```

#### 1.2 Code Quality Issues

**Critical: Monolithic Function**
- `estimate_parametric_hrf.R`: 1098 lines handling everything
- **Impact**: Unmaintainable, untestable, difficult to debug
- **Recommendation**: Refactor into stage functions:
  - `.validate_and_prepare()`
  - `.initialize_parameters()`
  - `.run_core_estimation()`
  - `.apply_global_refinement()`
  - `.apply_tiered_refinement()`
  - `.package_results()`

**High: Performance Bottlenecks**

1. **Post-refinement R² recalculation** (lines 607-632)
   - Nested loops over voxels and stimuli
   - Should use batch convolution

2. **Batch convolution inefficiency**
   - R loop instead of vectorization
   - Fix: Sum signals first, then single convolution

3. **Sequential voxel processing**
   - No parallelization in refinement functions
   - Should use `foreach` or `future.apply`

#### 1.3 Numerical Stability

**Medium: Matrix Dimension Issues**
- Reactive checks throughout code for matrix dimensions
- **Fix**: Consistently use `drop = FALSE` in all subsetting

**Medium: Ridge Solver Edge Case**
- No handling of singular matrices when `lambda = 0`
- Should document behavior or add pre-check

### Phase 2: API and Interface Analysis

#### 2.1 S3 Class Design ✅ Excellent

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive `parametric_hrf_fit` class structure
- Full suite of S3 methods matching R conventions
- Rich plotting functionality with multiple diagnostic types
- Backward compatibility handling

**Minor Issues:**
- Redundant fields for compatibility (e.g., `parameters` vs `estimated_parameters`)
- `vcov()` method misleadingly returns diagonal matrix only
- Missing `@examples` in documentation

#### 2.2 HRF Interface ✅ Well-designed

- Clean abstraction for HRF models
- Proper parameter bounds enforcement
- Defensive programming against `fmrihrf` package issues

### Phase 3: Cross-cutting Concerns

#### 3.1 Error Handling ✅ Excellent

**Strengths:**
- Consistent three-tier system (validation, runtime, recovery)
- High-quality error messages with context
- Sophisticated `.try_with_context` wrapper

#### 3.2 Code Patterns

**Good Practices:**
- Proper use of `requireNamespace()` for optional dependencies
- Resource cleanup with parallel backends
- No global state modification

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Inconsistent use of `::` for base/stats functions
- Magic numbers throughout code
- Code duplication in parallel dispatch logic

## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Create unified R² calculation function** and fix post-refinement calculation
2. **Begin refactoring `estimate_parametric_hrf.R`** into modular functions

### Short-term Improvements (High Priority)

3. **Vectorize performance bottlenecks**:
   - Post-refinement R² calculation
   - Batch convolution loop
   - Amplitude calculations

4. **Add parallelization** to refinement functions

5. **Add `@examples`** to all exported S3 methods

### Medium-term Enhancements

6. **Define named constants** for all magic numbers
7. **Abstract parallel dispatch logic** to eliminate duplication
8. **Improve test coverage** for edge cases identified

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Regression test** for the R² = 0 bug
2. **Unit tests** for Jacobian calculation
3. **Performance benchmarks** for vectorization improvements
4. **Edge case tests**:
   - Singular matrices (lambda = 0)
   - NA/NaN/Inf in input data
   - Zero variance voxels
   - Non-converging fits

## Conclusion

The fmriparametry package demonstrates sophisticated statistical methodology and generally high-quality R development. However, the identified issues—particularly the code complexity and performance bottlenecks—significantly impact its usability and maintainability. 

The most critical mathematical error (Jacobian calculation) has been fixed during this audit. The remaining recommendations, if implemented, would transform this from a functional research package into a robust, efficient, and maintainable tool suitable for widespread use in the neuroimaging community.

### Audit Metrics

- **Files Reviewed**: 10 core files + 4 cross-cutting samples
- **Critical Issues Found**: 2 (1 fixed)
- **High Priority Issues**: 5
- **Medium Priority Issues**: 4
- **Lines of Code Analyzed**: ~2000
- **Estimated Performance Improvement**: 5-10x for large datasets (after vectorization)

### Next Steps

1. Address the unified R² calculation immediately
2. Create a refactoring plan for the monolithic function
3. Implement performance optimizations with before/after benchmarks
4. Add comprehensive examples to documentation
5. Increase test coverage focusing on edge cases
