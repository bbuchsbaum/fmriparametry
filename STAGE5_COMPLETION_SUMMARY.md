# Stage 5 Completion Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed Stage 5 (Statistical Inference) and the final packaging of results. This completes the refactoring of the HRF estimation pipeline into a modular, staged architecture.

## Key Changes

### 1. Residuals and RMSE Calculation (estimation-stages.R)
- Modified `.package_final_results()` to properly compute residuals and RMSE
- Added logic to:
  - Use residuals from the parametric engine if available
  - Compute residuals from fitted values if needed
  - Recompute fitted values as a last resort
  - Calculate RMSE per voxel as `sqrt(mean(residuals^2))`

### 2. Data Flow Through Stages
- Enhanced Stage 2 to pass through residuals and intercepts from the core engine
- Updated Stage 3 to preserve residuals and intercepts during global refinement
- Modified Stage 4 to:
  - Pass through residuals and intercepts
  - Compute fitted values when refinement occurs
  - Update residuals when fitted values are recomputed

### 3. Input Validation
- Added proper validation for `theta_seed` length in Stage 1
- Added validation for `theta_bounds` structure and components
- Improved error messages to match test expectations

### 4. C++ Compatibility Fixes
- Added `storage.mode(X) <- "double"` conversions in:
  - `.ridge_linear_solve()` for matrix inputs
  - `.compute_standard_errors_delta()` for basis lists and HRF values
- Ensures proper type compatibility with RcppEigen functions

## Testing Results
All tests in `test-estimate-parametric-hrf.R` now pass:
- Input validation tests ✓
- Structure tests ✓
- Edge case handling ✓
- Total: 20 tests passed, 0 failed

## Residuals and Fit Quality
The final implementation properly tracks:
- Residuals throughout the pipeline
- RMSE calculation for fit quality assessment
- Fitted values when refinement occurs
- Proper handling of intercept terms

## Architecture Benefits
The staged architecture now provides:
1. **Modularity**: Each stage has a clear responsibility
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify or skip stages
3. **Efficiency**: Residuals/fitted values computed only when needed
4. **Maintainability**: Clear data flow between stages
5. **Testing**: Each stage can be tested independently

## Next Steps
The refactoring is complete. Consider:
1. Performance benchmarking vs. legacy implementation
2. Additional unit tests for individual stages
3. Documentation updates for the new architecture
4. Integration tests with real fMRI data
