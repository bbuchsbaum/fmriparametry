\usage{
single_voxel_sanity_check(
  y,
  onsets,
  parametric_hrf = "lwu",
  hrf_eval_times = seq(0, 30, by = 0.5),
  lambda_ridge = 0.01,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector of BOLD data (time points).}

\item{onsets}{Numeric vector of the same length with 1s at event onsets
and 0 elsewhere.}

\item{parametric_hrf}{Character string specifying the HRF model to use.
Currently only \code{"lwu"} is supported.}

\item{hrf_eval_times}{Numeric vector of times at which the HRF is
evaluated. Defaults to \code{seq(0, 30, by = 0.5)}.}

\item{lambda_ridge}{Numeric ridge penalty used in the linear solve.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print progress messages.}
}
\value{
List with elements \code{theta_hat}, \code{beta0} and
\code{r_squared} for the single voxel.
}
\description{
Fits the LWU parametric HRF model to a single time series with a
single-condition design. This helper exposes the minimal estimation
machinery for quick verification that the engine functions correctly.
