\title{Simple Bayesian HRF estimation engine}
\usage{
.bayesian_engine(Y, X, priors, mcmc_samples = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric vector of observed BOLD data}

\item{X}{Design matrix for the predicted response}

\item{priors}{List with elements \code{mean}, \code{var} and \code{sigma2}}

\item{mcmc_samples}{Number of posterior samples to draw}
}
\value{
List with posterior mean, sd and samples
}
\description{
This is a lightweight Bayesian alternative used mainly for testing the
plugin architecture. It performs conjugate Bayesian inference on the
amplitude parameter while treating the HRF parameters as fixed.
