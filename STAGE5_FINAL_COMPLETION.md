# Stage 5 Final Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully completed Stage 5 (Statistical Inference) implementation, fixing all identified issues.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Amplitude Standard Errors Not Computed
**Problem**: Amplitude SEs were not being computed despite the C++ function returning them.
**Root Cause**: Stage 4 was computing standard errors when `compute_se=TRUE`, which caused Stage 5 to skip SE computation (due to the check `!is.null(tiered_results$se_theta)`).
**Solution**: 
- Modified Stage 4 to use dummy SE values for voxel classification only
- Ensured Stage 4 always passes `se_theta = NULL` to Stage 5
- This allows Stage 5 to properly compute both parameter SEs and amplitude SEs

### 2. Version Field Empty
**Problem**: `fit$metadata$version` was showing as empty list instead of version string.
**Solution**: Changed `utils::packageVersion("fmriparametric")` to `as.character(utils::packageVersion("fmriparametric"))`

### 3. Data Flow Through Stages
**Problem**: `se_amplitudes` wasn't being passed through stages 3 and 4.
**Solution**: Added `se_amplitudes` to the return values of stages 3 and 4 to ensure proper data flow.

## Test Results
All tests now pass successfully:
- ✓ Standard errors computed
- ✓ Amplitude standard errors computed  
- ✓ Residuals computed (non-zero)
- ✓ RMSE computed
- ✓ Version displayed correctly
- ✓ All S3 methods working

## Architecture Benefits
The staged architecture successfully provides:
1. **Modularity**: Each stage has clear responsibility
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify or skip stages
3. **Efficiency**: SEs computed only when needed
4. **Maintainability**: Clear data flow between stages
5. **Testing**: Each stage can be tested independently

## Technical Details
- Stage 5 uses Delta method for standard error computation via C++ function
- Both parameter SEs (`se_theta_hat`) and amplitude SEs (`se_beta0`) are computed
- The C++ function `compute_standard_errors_bulk_cpp` handles the heavy lifting
- Proper storage mode conversions ensure C++ compatibility

## Status
The Strangler Fig refactoring is now COMPLETE with all stages (0-5) fully implemented and tested.
