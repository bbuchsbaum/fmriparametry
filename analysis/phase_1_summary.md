# Phase 1 Summary: R-squared Bug Fix

## Bug Description
R-squared values were calculated initially but not recalculated after parameter refinement, resulting in misleadingly low reported fit quality for refined voxels.

## Implementation

### Code Changes
Modified `estimate_parametric_hrf.R` (lines 587-624) to recalculate R-squared after refinement:

1. Generate HRF values using refined parameters for each voxel
2. Convolve HRF with design matrix to get fitted values  
3. Scale by refined amplitudes
4. Add baseline if present
5. Call `.compute_r_squared()` with updated fitted values

The implementation reuses the existing `.compute_r_squared()` function that was defined but never called.

### Logic Verification
The fix correctly:
- Uses refined `theta_current` parameters (HRF shape)
- Uses refined `amplitudes` (scaling factors)
- Includes baseline terms from `inputs$gamma_hat`
- Follows the same signal reconstruction process as the initial fit

## Testing Status

### Attempted Tests
1. Created characterization tests to demonstrate the bug
2. Created verification tests for the fix
3. Tests fail due to missing `fmrireg::hrf_basis_lwu` function

### Blocking Issue
The package depends on functions that don't exist in the current version of `fmrireg`:
- `hrf_lwu` - Used for HRF evaluation
- `hrf_basis_lwu` - Used for Taylor basis construction
- `lwu_hrf_seed` - Used for default parameters

These appear to be LWU-specific functions that were expected but not implemented in fmrireg v0.1.0.

## Assessment

### What's Complete
- Bug correctly identified
- Fix correctly implemented
- Code follows proper reconstruction logic

### What's Incomplete  
- Cannot verify fix works due to dependency issues
- Tests cannot pass without resolving fmrireg compatibility
- Package cannot build/check successfully

## Recommendation

Per Gemini's guidance, we should **not** consider this bug fixed until tests pass. The dependency issue must be resolved first before moving to Phase 2.

### Options for Resolution
1. **Update fmrireg**: Check if newer version has required functions
2. **Mock/stub functions**: Create temporary implementations for testing
3. **Alternative implementation**: Use different HRF functions that exist
4. **Fix fmrireg**: Add missing functions to the dependency

Without resolving the dependency issue, we cannot:
- Verify the R-squared fix works correctly
- Build the package successfully
- Have confidence in any further development

## Next Steps
1. Investigate fmrireg repository for LWU function status
2. Determine if functions were renamed/removed
3. Implement appropriate resolution
4. Verify R-squared fix with passing tests
5. Only then proceed to Phase 2
