# Phase 0.5 Summary: Dead Code Removal

## Actions Taken

### Files Moved to Attic (Fully Dead)
1. `rock-solid-memory.R` - 6/6 functions never called
2. `rock-solid-numerical.R` - 5/5 functions never called
3. `rock-solid-recovery.R` - 8/9 functions never called (1 self-referential)
4. `test_compatibility_layer.R` - 6/6 functions never called
5. `performance_optimizations.R` - 5/6 functions never called
6. `smart_performance_dispatcher.R` - Only test calls, no production use
7. `performance_enhancements.R` - 8/9 functions never called

### Live Functions Extracted
- From `rock-solid-validation.R` â†’ `validation-helpers.R`:
  - `.validate_fmri_data`
  - `.validate_event_model`
  - `.validate_theta_bounds`
  - `.validate_numeric_param`
  - `.rock_solid_validate_inputs`

### Duplicate Functions Resolved
- `.cached_qr_solve`: Removed both versions (not used in production)
- `.chunked_processing`: Removed both versions (not used in production)

## Results

### Before Phase 0.5
- Total functions: 134
- Never called: 88 (66%)
- Only in tests: 15

### After Phase 0.5
- Total functions: 90
- Never called: 54 (60%)
- Only in tests: 13

### Impact
- Removed 44 functions (33% reduction)
- Eliminated all "rock-solid" technical debt
- Removed duplicate implementations
- Cleaner, more focused codebase

## Remaining Issues

### Dead Code Still Present
1. **diagnostics.R** - All 4 functions never called
2. **internal-utils.R** - 9/10 functions never called
3. **local-recentering.R** - 1/1 function never called
4. **parallel-processing.R** - 6/10 functions never called
5. Many inline functions in `estimate_parametric_hrf.R` never called
6. Most S3 methods never called (but may be needed for public API)

### Next Steps
- Phase 1: Create tests and fix R-squared bug
- Phase 2: Further consolidation of remaining dead code
- Phase 3: Refactor the monolithic estimate_parametric_hrf.R
